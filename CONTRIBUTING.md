Submit a new issue only if you are sure it is a missing feature or a bug. Otherwise discuss the topic on the 
[mailing list](http://graphhopper.com/#developers) first.

## We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), optionally create a feature branch

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests: `mvn test`

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need
a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

For contributions like pull requests, bug fixes and translations please read and sign

## Syntax:

* Tell this your IDE or just use NetBeans which picks the format from pom.xml. E.g. no tabs - use 4 spaces instead!!
* Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.

And in case we didn't emphasize it enough: we love tests!
