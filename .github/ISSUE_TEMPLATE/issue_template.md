**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. For questions or usage problems please create a new topic in [our forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/graphhopper) instead.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior. For examples:

1. checkout recent and stable version of GraphHopper
2. link to your OSM pbf
3. include the config.yml you are using
4. run `java -Ddw.graphhopper.datareader.file=your.osm.pbf -jar *.jar server config-example.yml`

Instead of a manual reproduction it would be even better to have a unit or integration test reproducing the issue.

Provide version of Operating system, JVM and GraphHopper

**Screenshots & Logs**
