  ##### Vehicles #####


  # More options: foot,hike,bike,bike2,mtb,racingbike,motorcycle,car4wd,wheelchair (comma separated)
  # bike2 takes elevation data into account (like up-hill is slower than down-hill) and requires enabling graph.elevation.provider below.
  graph.flag_encoders: car

  # Enable turn restrictions for car or motorcycle.
  # graph.flag_encoders: car|turn_costs=true

  # Add additional information to every edge. Used for path details (#1548), better instructions (#1844) and tunnel/bridge interpolation (#798).
  # Default values are: road_class,road_class_link,road_environment,max_speed,road_access (since #1805)
  # More are: surface,max_width,max_height,max_weight,max_axle_load,max_length,hazmat,hazmat_tunnel,hazmat_water,toll,track_type
  # graph.encoded_values: surface,toll,track_type

  ##### Elevation #####


  # To populate your graph with elevation data use SRTM, default is noop (no elevation)
  # graph.elevation.provider: srtm


  # default location for cache is /tmp/srtm
  # graph.elevation.cache_dir: ./srtmprovider/


  # If you have a slow disk or plenty of RAM change the default MMAP to:
  # graph.elevation.dataaccess: RAM_STORE



  #### Speed, hybrid and flexible mode ####


  # By default the speed mode with the 'fastest' weighting is used. Internally a graph preparation via
  # contraction hierarchies (CH) is done to speed routing up. This requires more RAM/disc space for holding the
  # graph but less for every request. You can also setup multiple weightings, by providing a comma separated list.
  # To enable finite u-turn costs use something like fastest|u_turn_costs=30, where 30 are the u-turn costs in seconds
  # (given as integer). Note that since the u-turn costs are given in seconds the weighting you use should also
  # calculate the weight in seconds. The u-turn costs will only be applied for edge_based, see below.
  prepare.ch.weightings: fastest

  # Turn costs can be enabled also for speed mode (contraction hierarchies), but this requires a special kind of graph
  # preparation (which uses edge- instead of node-based graph traversal), which takes more time and memory than a
  # node-based preparation. You can also perform both node- and edge-based preparation for the same vehicle. This will
  # allow switching between faster node-based routing and slower edge-based routing which supports turn costs.
  # Using the following option you can specify what kind of preparation shall be performed for the different vehicles.
  # You can choose:
  # 'off': there will be no edge-based preparation for any of the vehicles, you will not be able to use turn costs
  #        with speed mode
  # 'edge_or_node': use edge-based preparation for all vehicles with |turn_costs=true (see graph.flag_encoders) and
  #                 node-based preparation for all others
  # 'edge_and_node': use node-based preparation for all vehicles and additionally use edge-based preparation for all
  #                  vehicles with |turn_costs=true
  prepare.ch.edge_based: off


  # Disable the speed mode. Should be used only with routing.max_visited_nodes or when the hybrid mode is enabled instead
  # prepare.ch.weightings: no


  # To make CH preparation faster for multiple flagEncoders you can increase the default threads if you have enough RAM.
  # Change this setting only if you know what you are doing and if the default worked for you.
  # prepare.ch.threads: 1


  # The hybrid mode can be enabled with
  # prepare.lm.weightings: fastest

  # To tune the performance vs. memory usage for the hybrid mode use
  # prepare.lm.landmarks: 16

  # Make landmark preparation parallel if you have enough RAM. Change this only if you know what you are doing and if the default worked for you.
  # prepare.lm.threads: 1


  # avoid being stuck in a (oneway) subnetwork, see https://discuss.graphhopper.com/t/93
  prepare.min_network_size: 200
  prepare.min_one_way_network_size: 200



  ##### Routing #####


  # You can define the maximum visited nodes when routing. This may result in not found connections if there is no
  # connection between two points within the given visited nodes. The default is Integer.MAX_VALUE. Useful for flexibility mode
  # routing.max_visited_nodes: 1000000


  # If enabled, allows a user to run flexibility requests even if speed mode is enabled. Every request then has to include a hint ch.disable=true.
  # Attention, non-CH route calculations take way more time and resources, compared to CH routing.
  # A possible attacker might exploit this to slow down your service. Only enable it if you need it and with routing.maxVisitedNodes
  # routing.ch.disabling_allowed: true


  # If enabled, allows a user to run flexible mode requests even if the hybrid mode is enabled. Every such request then has to include a hint routing.lm.disable=true.
  # routing.lm.disabling_allowed: true

  # Control how many active landmarks are picked per default, this can improve query performance
  # routing.lm.active_landmarks: 4


  # You can limit the max distance between two consecutive waypoints of flexible routing requests to be less or equal
  # the given distance in meter. Default is set to 1000km.
  routing.non_ch.max_waypoint_distance: 1000000


  ##### Storage #####


  # configure the memory access, use RAM_STORE for well equipped servers (default and recommended)
  graph.dataaccess: RAM_STORE


  # will write way names in the preferred language (language code as defined in ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2):
  # datareader.preferred_language: en


  # Sort the graph after import to make requests roughly ~10% faster. Note that this requires significantly more RAM on import.
  # graph.do_sort: true



  ##### Spatial Rules #####
  # Spatial Rules require some configuration and only work with the DataFlagEncoder.


  # Spatial Rules require you to provide Polygons in which the rules are enforced
  # The line below contains the default location for the files which define these borders
  # spatial_rules.borders_directory: core/files/spatialrules

  # You can define the maximum BBox for which spatial rules are loaded.
  # You might want to do this if you are only importing a small area and don't need rules for other countries.
  # Having less rules, might result in a smaller graph. The line below contains the world-wide bounding box, uncomment and adapt to your need.
  # spatial_rules.max_bbox: -180,180,-90,90
