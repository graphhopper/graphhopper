0.7    
    web API: content type of gpx export is now application/gpx+xml if not explicitely specified
    use prepare.chWeightings instead of prepare.chWeighting e.g. for disabling CH use prepare.chWeightings=no
    GraphHopper class is refactored regarding RoutingAlgorithmFactory in order to fix problem when integrating flexibility routing, most of the CH related stuff is moved into CHAlgoFactoryDecorator, several methods are deprecated to use the methods of the decorator, see #631
    WeightingMap is now named HintsMap
    use the correct graphHopperFolder as no automatic fallback to 'folder-gh' is happening anymore, see #704
    refactored FlagEncoder.handleFerryWay to getFerrySpeed to make it possible to fix #665
    removed setWeightLimit as too unspecific for arbitrary weights, use setMaxVisitedNodes instead
    missing renames for Path.setEdgeEntry -> setSPTEntry and AbstractAlgorithm.createEdgeEntry -> createSPTEntry

0.6
    removed methods deprecated in 0.4 and 0.5
    renamed EdgeEntry to SPTEntry and AStar.AStarEdge to AStar.AStarEntry
    parameter force removed from AbstractFlagEncoder.applyMaxSpeed
    GHResponse now wraps multiple PathWrapper; renamed GraphHopper.getPaths to calcPaths as 'get' sounded too cheap; a new method RoutingAlgorithm.calcPaths is added; see #596
    moving lgpl licensed file into own submodule graphhopper-tools-lgpl
    renaming of Tarjans algorithm class to TarjansSCCAlgorithm
    more strict naming for Weighting enforced and more strict matching to select Weighting (equals check), #490
    specify the preferred-language for way names during graph import (ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2)
    renaming of getCHWeighting to getCHWeightings due to supporting multiple CH weightings, #623
    deprecation of setCHWeighting, please use setCHWeightings instead, #623

0.5
    Several names have changed see #466, #467, #468
    GraphHopper.optimize removed use postProcessing instead
    method GraphHopper.getGraph() changed to getGraphHopperStorage()
    the interface GraphStorage does no longer extend from the Graph interface. Use GraphHopperStorage (which implements the Graph interface via the base graph) or only Graph instead
    now it is necessary to call baseGraph/chGraph.freeze in order to use the chGraph (to simply determine when an edgeId is a shortcut)    
    LevelGraphStorage is now a GraphHopperStorage with an additional ch graph (CHGraphImpl)
    GraphHopperStorage implements now the Graph interface and delegates all necessary methods to the underlying base graph. To do routing you call getGraph(CHGraph.class or Graph.class) where the parameter Graph.class returns the base graph and the behaviour is identical to GraphHopperStorage itself
    renamed LevelGraph* to CHGraph*
    renamed NoGraphExtension to NoOpExtension
    removed visitedNodes method in GraphHopper replaced with per response information: response.getHints().getLong("visited_nodes.sum", 0)
    added ability to store hints in GHResponse which will be forwarded to the json too
    breaking change in HTTP API: error JSON format changed to be message:"" instead of within info.errors, see updated api documentation
    made GHResponse.getMillis, Path.getMillis, GPXEntry.getMillis deprecated, use getTime instead
    in AbstractFlagEncoder, parse*() and getStr() are now deprecated, use properties.get* instead

0.4
    translation key turn changed and merged with left etc into turn_left, turn_right etc
    create location index before preparation in the GraphHopper class
    encodingManager.getSingle() is removed and flagEncoder list is no longer sorted, the first vehicle is used for CH preparation    
    removed LocationIndexTreeSC, use new LocationIndexTree(levelGraph.getBaseGraph(), directory) instead
    getLevel and setLevel do no longer automatically increase node count, use getNodeAccess.ensureNode for that
    normal algorithms are now possible on prepared graph use getBaseGraph, see #116
    GHResponse no longer has isFound method, use !hasErrors instead
    merged unused Edge class into EdgeEntry
    astar and astarbi are now both none-heuristic and take parameters for beeline approximation: astar.approximation=BeelineSimplification|BeelineAccurate or astarbi.approximation=...
    making GPX export according to the schema to support import from various tools like basecamp
    refactoring: AllEdgesIterator.getMaxId is now named getCount
    major change of internal API: moved method "Path RoutingAlgorithm.calcPath(QueryResult,QueryResult)" to a helper method QueryGraph.lookup, call queryResult.getClosestNode for the calcPath(nodeFrom,nodeTo) method
    no cachedWays and cachedPoints in Path anymore
    Path.findInstruction was moved to InstructionList.find
    if start and end point are identical an algorithm will find the path consisting only of one node, one point and one instruction (finish instruction), but without edges
    astarbi has new default values for approximation (false) and approximation_factor (1.2) in RoutingAlgorithmFactorySimple
    instead of strings use the variables in AlgorithmOptions to specify an algorithm
    use RoutingAlgorithmFactorySimple instead of RoutingAlgorithmFactory, also more constistent algorithm preparation handling due to new AlgorithmOptions, therefor removed NoOpAlgorithmPreparation
    GHResponse.getXX methods now fail fast (throw an exception) if an error while route calculation occured. See #287
    renamed less often used URL parameter 'min_path_precision' to way_point_max_distance which makes it identical to the setWayPointMaxDistance method used for simplification at OSMImport
    removed douglas.minprecision from Java API ghRequest.hints => use wayPointMaxDistance instead
    encoder.supportTurnCost is replaced by encoder.supports(TurnWeighting.class)
    CmdArgs is now a Map<String, String> instead Map<String, Object>. The value will be parsed up on every getXY call, makes storing string vs. object less error-prone
    removed GHRequest.getHint, instead use the provided methods in GHRequest.getHints().getXY and GHRequest.getHints().put
    important graph incompatibility as properties cannot be loaded. renamed osmreader.bytesForFlags to graph.bytesForFlags, renamed config property osmreader.acceptWay to graph.flagEncoders
    default weighting is now fastest, fixing #261
    moved method GraphHopper.main into tools module and class com.graphhopper.tools.Import, see #250
    refactored GraphHopper.createWeighting to accept more than one configuration option, see #237
    refactored GraphHopper.disableCHShortcuts to setCHEnable(boolean)
    moving the boolean parameter of GraphHopper.setInMemory into a separate method setStoreOnFlush
    renaming of GraphHopper.setCHShortcuts to setCHWeighting, as well as the property prepare.chShortcuts to prepare.chWeighting
    jsonp is disabled by default. You need to enable it in the config.properties, see the config-example.properties
    EncodingManager cannot be null in GraphHopperStorage. If you need to parse EncodingManager configuration from existing graph use EncodingManager.create
    no reflection done in EncodingManager which improves portability and makes configuration of encoders possible before adding to manager
    removed dijkstraNativebi as no performance advantage but maintenance disadvantage and similar to oneToManyDijkstra
    to provide context for turn costs we needed to add prevEdgeId into Weighting.calcWeight, see new documentation
    with the introduction of lock protection mechanism (see #112) GraphHopper needs always write access, see also #217
    new GraphHopper.clean method to remove the graph directory via Java API    

0.3.0
    introduced prefer bits, now bike uses more bits and 3 bike encoder do not fit into 32 bit anymore, will be fixed later
    moved Translation argument into Path.calcInstruction for more fine grained control, instructions are now uncached and GHRequest: new locale parameter
    CoordTrig and the like are removed, GHPlace is mostly replaced by GHPoint and so GHRequest has now methods ala addPoint instead
    removed isBoth from AbstractFlagEncoder, moved canBeOverwritten and associated test to PrepareEncoder
    removed unused directory.rename
    refactor edge.copyProperties into copyPropertiesTo to have similar semantics as Graph.copyTo
    calcWeight now contains reverse boolean to calculate correct direction dependent weight
    completely different web API response format. see docs/web
    swapDirections is renamed to reverseFlags (EncodingManager and FlagEncoders)
    edgeState.detach has now a reverse parameter, just use false to get previous results
    web api: buildDate contains now timezone, algoType is replaced with weighting
    dijkstraNative is now dijkstraNativebi
    fixed #151
    calcWeight now contains reverse boolean to calculate correct direction dependent weight
    EncodingManager always takes the encoders in constructor, to force always init
    GraphHopper.setMemory(true, true/false) was refactored to GraphHopper.setMemory(true/false), use mmap config via GraphHopper.setMemoryMapped()
    incompatible edges => you need to re-import data and/or update the edges file
    the instructions of the web response does not contain times (string) but instead millis (long)
    PrepareContractionHierarchies.setPeriodicUpdates is now in percentage not in absolute counts
    improved bike routing #132, #138, #139, #150
    gpx export via API, HTTP (route?type=gpx) and web interface is possible: #113, #136, #141   

0.2.0
23 Nov 2013

    change inconsistent default settings for contraction hierarchies in the API - see https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/graphhopper/2013-December/000585.html
    fixed issues with android:
        graphhopper: use maps from 0.2 path; updated maps
        mapsforge: use mapsforge-map dependency; merged #461; avoid duplicates otherwise mapsforge-core would be duplicate (?)
    refactored/renamed classes and methods:
        refactor 'flags' from int to long (still only int is stored)
        replacing Graph.edge(a,b,dist,flags) by Graph.edge(a,b).setDistance().setFlags()
        FlagEncoder.flags => use FlagEncoder.setProperties or separate setAccess and setSpeed method
        renamed LocationIDResult to QueryResult and Location2NodesNtree to LocationIndexTree
        renamed Location2IDIndex to LocationIndex
        renamed WeightCalculation to Weighting and getWeight to calcWeight        
            the URL parameter algoType in web module is now deprecated and 'weighting' should be used
        removed GHDijkstraHeap, GHDijkstraHeap2    
        made DistanceCalc into interface (new DistanceCalcEarth implementation)
        made GraphStorage into interface (new GraphHopperStorage implementation) move some methods from Graph into GraphStorage -> optimize + node removal stuff -> not necessary in algorithms
    incompatible storage layout due to:
        pluggable endianness (#103) -> changed default endianess to LITTLE
    add highly experimental UnsafeDataAccess to speed up search ~15%

        case of vehicle now case does not matter
        returned distance is in meter now
    better i18n support
    fixed major bug #102 when removing subnetworks
