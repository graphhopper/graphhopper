A fast and memory efficient Java road routing engine under Apache License 2.0

Get Started & Contribute
---------------

Read the information for [Developers](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/wiki/Developers) and sign up to [our mailing list](http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/graphhopper).

**Please only email me directly if you need consultancy** or can't explain your problem in the public.

There are also subprojects to make GraphHopper working on [Android](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/wiki/Android) or as a [web service](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-web).


Purpose
---------------

Solving shortest path (related) problems is the main goal. GraphHopper is a routing engine which
makes implementing shortest path problems in Java easier and more efficient (faster, less memory, etc) than
a naive implementation.
GraphHopper is tuned for road networks at the moment but can be useful for public transport problems in
the future as well.

Features
---------------

 * Written in Java
 * Open Source
 * Memory efficient and fast
 * A small library (~3MB)
 * Works on the [desktop](http://karussell.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/graphhopper.png), 
   [as a web service](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-web) 
   and even offline [on Android](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/wiki/Android)
 * Well tested
