# GraphHopper Documentation

## Getting Started

Try out our live demo called [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

 [![GraphHopper Maps](https://karussell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/graphhopper-maps-0-4-preview.png)](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

[The Readme](../README.md#features) lists all features or [this list of slides](https://graphhopper.com/public/slides/).

See [more users of GraphHopper](https://graphhopper.com/#usecases) or [Android apps](./android/index.md#apps) and let us know your application!

## Web

The web module provides a web API for other programming languages as well as starts a simple user interface called GraphHopper Maps

 * [Routing API](./web/api-doc.md): Documentation of the Web API to communicate with any GraphHopper server via http.
 * [Deployment Guide](./core/deploy.md): Details about deploying GraphHopper
 * [Postgis query script](../core/files/postgis)
 * There are official API clients in [Java](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-java-client/) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client).

### Configuration

You can configure several aspects either programmatically or just via the [config.properties](../config-example.properties).

The elevation configuration is separately documented [here](./core/elevation.md).

## Developer
