# Spatial Rules

Spatial rules allow you to create rules for certain areas. One example is that the default accessibility for 
`highway=track` in Austria is `access=yes`, whereas the default accessibility is `access=destination` in Germany. Other 
examples are different max speeds for different countries. More information on different road rules can be found in the 
OSM wiki, different [accessibilities](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing/Access-Restrictions) and 
different [speeds](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing/Maxspeed#Motorcar).

## Enabling Rules

I you have a working GraphHopper setup it is easy to enable Spatial Rules, **but they only work with the DataFlagEncoder**.
We provide a set of approximate country borders, within the GraphHopper repository. If you need exact borders you can
get the exact borders from [here](https://github.com/datasets/geo-countries). Go to your
`config.yml` file and
uncommend the line: `spatial_rules.borders_directory` and point it to the directory where your rules are. You need to re-import your graph after that.

## Creating Rules

Writing your own rules is simple. If you write a rule for a country that is not provided in GraphHopper yet, we'd love
if you would contribute your rules. You can have a look at the [GermanySpatialRule](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/routing/util/spatialrules/countries/GermanySpatialRule.java).
Create something similar for your country. After that you have to extend the [CountriesSpatialRuleFactory](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/web/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/spatialrules/CountriesSpatialRuleFactory.java) 
to match your country code.
