/**
 * Detects and marks 'subnetworks' with a dedicated subnetwork encoded value. Subnetworks are parts of the road network
 * that are not connected to the rest of the network and that are below a certain size. These can be isolated nodes with
 * no edges at all, but also small subnetworks which could be bugs in OSM data or 'islands' that are separated from
 * the rest of the network because of some missing link, barrier or some closed road for example.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes there are also subnetworks that can be reached from the main network but not the other way around (or the
 * opposite). For example this can be parking lots that can only be accessed by a single one-way road (a mapping error).
 * These are called 'one-way subnetworks' and are marked using the same subnetwork encoded value, see #86. To find such
 * one-way subnetworks it is important to search for strongly connected components on the directed graph and not do a
 * simple connectivity check for one direction.
 * <p>
 * Note that it depends on the weighting whether or not edges belong to a subnetwork or not. For example if a weighting
 * 'closes' a bridge to an island the island might become a subnetwork, but if the bridge was open it would belong to
 * the main network. There can even be subnetworks that are due to turn restrictions.
 * <p>
 * We always run an edge-based connected component search, because this way we retrieve the edges (not the nodes) that
 * belong to each component and can include turn restrictions as well. Node-based component search is faster, but since
 * the subnetwork search goes relatively fast anyway using it has no real benefit.
