# in meter

vehicle_width: 2.5
# in tons
vehicle_weight: 4.5

# The formula is defined in CustomWeighting, where the speed_factor can be used to decrease speed.
# The minimum value is 0 and the maximum is 1. If two conditions are satisfied the values are
# multiplied e.g. if road_class==motorway and road_environment==tunnel, then the resulting speed is
# average_speed*0.85*0.9.
speed_factor:
  road_environment:
    tunnel: 0.85
  # trucks should be a bit slower on certain road classes compared to the 'base' car
  # a more compact JSON-way to list the properties, fully YAML-compatible:
  road_class: { motorway: 0.85, primary: 0.9 }

# You can lower the average speed for certain conditions via this max_speed entry. The speed_factor is applied before
# this operation. See the following example that sets the maximum speed to 95km/h for motorways.
max_speed:
  road_class:
    motorway: 95
    residential: 30
  road_environment:
    bridge: 85
# Trucks are slower so limit all speed to this value. In km/h
# If none of the conditions in the map above apply use the fallback, if specified:
max_speed_fallback: 100

# This term changes the influence of the distance. I.e. longer roads get a higher cost.
# The distance_influence is independent of the edge properties and does not influence the ETA. The default is 70 (seconds/1km).
# Let's assume a route that takes 1000sec and is 10km long, then a value of 30 means that I would like to drive maximum 11km
# to reduce the travel time to 970sec or 12km to reduce it to 940sec.
distance_influence: 90

# Now we want to set a preference without changing the taken time. The default priority is 1 and does not change something.
# Higher than 1 will prefer the road under the specified condition and lower than 1 will avoid it.
# If two conditions are met the values will be multiplied. The minimum value is 0 (block access) the maximum value is 100.
priority:
  road_class:
    motorway: 1.1
    residential: 0.5
    # cars allow tracks so we should block them here, but in the example in CustomWeightingRouteResourceTest the bridge is only accessible through a track
    # track: 0
  # let's assume we transport gas: so NEVER go on restricted roads with hazmat==no
  hazmat: { no: 0 }
  # avoid destination-only roads
  # TODO include private and delivery only access for base car profile so that we can avoid it here, but not exclude it
  road_access: { destination: 0.1 }
  # avoid turns if possible and links are one simple indication for that
  road_class_link: 0.5
  # avoid toll roads
  toll: { no: 2 }
  # avoid a certain area
