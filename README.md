GraphHopper Maps uses the [Directions API for Business](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api), which provides 
routing and matrix routing through GraphHopper and also a fast address search via [Photon](https://github.com/komoot/photon).
Additionally the map tiles from various Providers are used and all is 
available for free for a nice route planning experience!
