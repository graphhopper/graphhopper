# GraphHopper Documentation

## Getting Started

Try out our live demo called [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

 [![GraphHopper Maps](https://karussell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/graphhopper-maps-0-4-preview.png)](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

[The Readme](../README.md#features) lists all features or [this list of slides](https://graphhopper.com/public/slides/).
See [users of GraphHopper](https://www.graphhopper.com/showcases/) or [Android apps](./android/index.md#apps) and let us know your application!

## Contact

## For Users

Install the web demo 'GraphHopper Maps' with [this user guide](./web/quickstart.md) on your machine
or the [Android demo](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/README.md#get-started).

#### Web

The web module provides a web API for other programming languages as well as starts a simple user interface called GraphHopper Maps

 * [Routing API](./web/api-doc.md): Documentation of the Web API to communicate with any GraphHopper server via http.
 * [Deployment Guide](./core/deploy.md): Details about deploying GraphHopper 
 * There are official API clients in [Java](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/tree/master/client-hc) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client).

#### Configuration

You can configure several aspects either programmatically or just via a [configuration](../config-example.yml).

The elevation configuration is separately documented [here](./core/elevation.md).

## For Developers

[The quickstart](./core/quickstart-from-source.md) is an introduction for developers. Explains git checkout, IDE setup and commands for setting up a GraphHopper server.

Find all changes in previous and current versions in the [changelogs](../core/files/changelog.txt).
