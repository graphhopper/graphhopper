/**
 * Turns an unidirectional weight Approximation into a bidirectional balanced one.
 * This means it can be used with an A* implementation that uses the stopping criterion
 * described in [1].
 *
 * Note: In the paper, it is called a consistent (rather than balanced)
 * approximator, but as noted in [2], consistent also means a different property which
 * an approximator must already have before it should be plugged into this class (!).
 *
 * Most literature uses balanced for the property that this class is about.
