**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. If you are unsure if this is really a bug, please create a new topic in [our forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/graphhopper).

If you have an Android application that uses GraphHopper, please always post to the [forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/graphhopper/graphhopper-ios-and-android) before and include logs and the version of
your Android system.

**To Reproduce**

1. checkout recent and stable version of GraphHopper
2. download a certain.pbf
3. run e.g. graphhopper.sh script like: `./graphhopper.sh web certain.pbf`
4. See error

Instead of a manual reproduction it would be even better to have a unit or integration test reproducing the issue.
