# GraphHopper Navigation Module

This web service returns JSON from the [GraphHopper routing engine](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper) that is consumable with 
the [Android Navigation SDK](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-android). I.e. it provides the server side part of a navigation application.

An example for an Android app that uses the Navigation SDK is provided in [this repository](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example).
