# GraphHopper Routing Engine

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper)

GraphHopper is a fast and memory efficient Java routing engine, released under Apache License 2.0.
By default it uses OpenStreetMap and GTFS data, but it can import other data sources.

## Questions

All questions can go to our [forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/) where we also have subsections specially for developers, mobile usage (iOS&Android), and [our map matching component](https://github.com/graphhopper/map-matching). Another place to ask questions would be on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/graphhopper), but please do **not** use our issue section. Create new issues only if you are sure that this is a bug. Also, see how to contribute in the next section.

## Contribute

Read through [how to contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on topics
like finding and fixing bugs and improving our documentation or translations!

## For the Web

See GraphHopper in action on [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

[![GraphHopper Maps](https://karussell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/graphhopper-maps-0-4-preview.png)](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

GraphHopper Maps uses the [Directions API for Business](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api) under the hood, which provides 
a Routing API via GraphHopper, a Route Optimization API via [jsprit](http://jsprit.github.io/), a fast Matrix API
and an address search via [Photon](https://github.com/komoot/photon). Additionally, map tiles from various providers are used 
where the default is [Omniscale](http://omniscale.com/). All of these are available for free, via encrypted connections and from German servers for a nice and private route planning experience!


## For Mobile Apps

There are subprojects to make GraphHopper working offline
on [Android](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/tree/master/android)
and [iOS](http://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-ios)

## For Analysis

There is the isochrone subproject to calculate and visualize the reachable area for a certain travel mode

**[Isochrone Web API](./docs/web/api-doc.md#isochrone)**

# Technical Overview

GraphHopper supports several routing algorithms, such as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A</a>`*` and its bidirectional variants. 
Furthermore, it allows you to use 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies">Contraction Hierarchies</a> (CH) 
very easily. We call this **speed mode**; without this CH preparation, we call it **flexible mode**.

The speed mode comes with very fast and lightweight (less RAM) responses, although it does not use heuristics 
in its default settings. The downsides are that the speed mode allows only pre-defined vehicle profiles (multiple possible in GraphHopper) 
and requires a time consuming and resource-intensive preparation. Finally, implementing certain features is not possible 
or very complex compared to the flexible mode. 

The **hybrid mode** also requires preparation time and memory,
but it is much more flexible regarding changing properties per request or e.g. integrating traffic data and more. 
Furthermore, this hybrid mode is slower than the speed mode, but it is an 
order of magnitude faster than the flexible mode and uses also less RAM for one request.

You can switch between all modes at request time.

## License

We chose the Apache License to make it easy for you to embed GraphHopper in your products, even closed source.
We suggest that you contribute back your changes, as GraphHopper evolves fast,
but of course this is not necessary.

## OpenStreetMap Support

OpenStreetMap is directly supported from GraphHopper. Without the amazing data from
OpenStreetMap, GraphHopper wouldn't be possible at all.
Other map data will need a custom import procedure, see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues/277">Ordnance Survey</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/tree/master/reader-shp">Shapefile like ESRI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/knowname/morituri">Navteq</a>.

## Written in Java

GraphHopper is written in Java and runs on Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows, BSD, Solaris, Raspberry Pi, Android, Blackberry, and even iOS.

### Maven

Embed GraphHopper with OpenStreetMap support into your Java application via the following snippet:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.graphhopper</groupId>
    <artifactId>graphhopper-reader-osm</artifactId>
    <version>[LATEST-VERSION]</version>
</dependency>
```

If you want to write your own import procedure or you don't need OSM import like
on [Android](./docs/android/index.md), then use:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.graphhopper</groupId>
    <artifactId>graphhopper-core</artifactId>
    <version>[LATEST-VERSION]</version>
</dependency>
```

## Customizable

We've built the GraphHopper class which makes simple things easy and complex things like multi-modal routing possible. 
Still, you can use the low level API of GraphHopper and you'll see that
it was created to allow fast and memory efficient use of the underlying data structures and algorithms.

### Android / Blackberry

On Android and Blackberry (since 10.2.1), we provide an integration with Mapsforge which makes offline navigation one step closer.
Due to the usage of memory mapped files and Contraction Hierarchies,
we avoid allocating too much memory. This makes it possible to run Germany-wide queries with only 
32MB in a few seconds. We provide an Android studio project as well as the Maven-Android integration to be 
used in other IDEs.

### Web UI and API

With the web module, we provide code to query GraphHopper over HTTP and decrease bandwidth usage as much as possible.
For that we use a polyline encoding from Google, the Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm, and a simple 
GZIP servlet filter.                 
On the client side, we provide Java and JavaScript code (via Leaflet) to consume that service and 
visualize the routes.

### Desktop

GraphHopper also runs on the Desktop in a Java application without internet access.
E.g. you could use the rough user interface called MiniGraphUI provided in the tools module, see some
visualizations done with it [here](https://graphhopper.com/blog/2016/01/19/alternative-roads-to-rome/).
A fast and production ready map visualization for the Desktop can be easily implemented via mapsforge.

### Docker

Install GraphHopper via [Docker](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/849).
You only need to change the docker-compose.yml entrypoint in core/files/ to run whatever map you like.
Then just type:
```bash
cd core/files/
docker-compose up -d
```

If you don't want to use docker-compose you can do the following:
```bash
docker build -t graphhopper:master .
docker run -d --name graphhopper -v <path_data_directory>/data:/data -p 11111:11111 graphhopper:master
```


# Features
