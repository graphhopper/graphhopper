# Handcrafted Java and Android client for the GraphHopper Directions API

We have a hand-crafted API client (`client-hc`) for several API parts like the Matrix and Routing API that is more memory efficient 
e.g. for large matrices than the autogenerated client. To use this project
include the following Maven snippet:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.graphhopper</groupId>
  <artifactId>directions-api-client-hc</artifactId>
  <version>[CURRENT-VERSION]</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

A real world example for the Routing and Matrix API can be found
[here](./src/test/java/com/graphhopper/api/Examples.java).

## License

## Usage

You can use the API client for many API parts:

 * the Geocoding API
 * the Route Optimization API
 * the Routing API
 * the Matrix API
 * the Isochrone API
 
For the Route Optimization API you can create the sources from our OpenAPI spec. 
See [this repository](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-clients#deprecated-notice) for more details about it.

## Android 

It is important to use this client not on the main thread of Android as it could block the app. 
See [issue 7](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-java-client/issues/7) for more information.

### Android Alternative

The OSM [OSMBonusPack](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/Tutorial_1) also has
an Android client written from the community. It also supports 
online map tiles. You can see this code in action in 
[Geopaparazzi](http://geopaparazzi.github.io/geopaparazzi/), 
[OSMNavigator](https://github.com/MKergall/osmbonuspack/wiki/OSMNavigator) and [more](https://github.com/geopaparazzi/geopaparazzi/wiki/Projects-Using-It)
