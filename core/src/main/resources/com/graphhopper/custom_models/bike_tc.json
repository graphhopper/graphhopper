// Configures bike that avoids zig-zag routes and uses the turn_costs based approach to avoid private-only and destination-only roads.
//
// Note, it is not recommended to increase these costs heavily as otherwise larger, bike-unfriendly
// roads will be preferred as they often require less turns.
//
// To use this custom model you need to set the following option in the config.yml
// graph.elevation.provider: srtm   # enables elevation
// graph.encoded_values: bike_priority, bike_access, roundabout, bike_average_speed, bike_road_access, average_slope, orientation
// profiles:
//    - name: bike
//      turn_costs:
//        vehicle_types: [bicycle]
//        u_turn_costs: 20
//      custom_model_files: [bike_tc.json, avoid_turns.json, avoid_private_etc.json, bike_elevation.json]
