/**
 * Implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for time-inhomogeneous Markov processes,
 * meaning that the set of states and state transition probabilities are not necessarily fixed
 * for all time steps. The plain Viterbi algorithm for stationary Markov processes is described e.g.
 * in Rabiner, Juang, An introduction to Hidden Markov Models, IEEE ASSP Mag., pp 4-16, June 1986.
 *
 * <p>Generally expects logarithmic probabilities as input to prevent arithmetic underflows for
 * small probability values.
 *
 * <p>This algorithm supports storing transition objects in
 * {@link #nextStep(Object, Collection, Map, Map, Map)}. For instance if a HMM is
 * used for map matching, this could be routes between road position candidates.
 * The transition descriptors of the most likely sequence can be retrieved later in
 * {@link SequenceState#transitionDescriptor} and hence do not need to be stored by the
 * caller. Since the caller does not know in advance which transitions will occur in the most
 * likely sequence, this reduces the number of transitions that need to be kept in memory
 * from t*nÂ² to t*n since only one transition descriptor is stored per back pointer,
 * where t is the number of time steps and n the number of candidates per time step.
 *
 * <p>For long observation sequences, back pointers usually converge to a single path after a
 * certain number of time steps. For instance, when matching GPS coordinates to roads, the last
 * GPS positions in the trace usually do not affect the first road matches anymore.
 * This implementation exploits this fact by letting the Java garbage collector
 * take care of unreachable back pointers. If back pointers converge to a single path after a
 * constant number of time steps, only O(t) back pointers and transition descriptors need to be
 * stored in memory.
 *
 * @param <S> the state type
 * @param <O> the observation type
 * @param <D> the transition descriptor type. Pass {@link Object} if transition descriptors are not
 * needed.
