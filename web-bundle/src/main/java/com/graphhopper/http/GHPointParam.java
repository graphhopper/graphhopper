/**
 * This is a glue type, used to plug GHPoint as a custom web resource parameter type into Dropwizard,
 * in order to get the best handling of exceptions, validation messages, and such.
 *
 * The structure of this class (including both delegating constructors) should probably be left exactly as it is,
 * and behavior implemented with this should be under tests, because Dropwizard slurps it in by reflection,
 * and I don't know how stable that is over Dropwizard versions.
 *
 * This is only for annotated parameters that go directly into web resources, especially as a QueryParam.
 * Don't use it for fields in body types that go through Jackson ("entities").
