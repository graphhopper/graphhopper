# GraphHopper Documentation

## First Steps

Try out our live demo called [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

 [![GraphHopper Maps](https://karussell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/graphhopper-maps-0-4-preview.png)](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

[The Readme](../README.md#features) lists all features or [this list of slides](https://graphhopper.com/public/slides/).
See [users of GraphHopper](https://www.graphhopper.com/showcases/) and let us know your application!

## Community

## Installation

Install the web demo 'GraphHopper Maps' with [this user installation guide](./web/quickstart.md) on your
machine. This will also install a web API that can be used in many programming languages.

 * [Routing API](./web/api-doc.md): Documentation of the Web API to communicate with any GraphHopper server via http.
 * [Deployment Guide](./core/deploy.md): Details about deploying GraphHopper 
 * There are official API clients in [Java](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/tree/master/client-hc) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client).

#### Configuration

You can configure several aspects either programmatically or just via a [configuration](../config-example.yml).
The configuration of routing profiles is documented [here](./core/profiles.md).
The elevation configuration is separately documented [here](./core/elevation.md).

## Installation For Developers

[The quickstart](./core/quickstart-from-source.md) is an introduction for developers. Explains git checkout, IDE setup and commands for setting up a GraphHopper server.

Find all changes in previous and current versions in the [changelogs](../core/files/changelog.txt).

#### Contribute

Read [here](../CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute as a developer and translator.

#### Technical

Various topics are explained in more detail separately:

 * [Technical overview](./core/technical.md): Technical details about how GraphHopper its calculations are working.
 * [Simple routing](./core/routing.md): Tutorial how to integrate GraphHopper in your Java application (or pick any JVM language)
 * [Create custom weighting](./core/weighting.md): Documentation about how to create a custom weighting class to influence the track calculation.
 * [Import GTFS](../reader-gtfs): Simple steps to get GTFS import and routing done.
 * [LocationIndex](./core/location-index.md): Documentation about how to get the location index for getting i.e. the nearest edge. 
 * [Hybrid Mode](./core/landmarks.md): Details about speeding up the route calculation via A* and landmarks.

 * [Low level API](./core/low-level-api.md): Instructions how to use GraphHopper as a Java library.
 * [Create new FlagEncoder](./core/create-new-flagencoder.md): Documentation to create new routing profiles to influence which ways to favor and how the track-time is calculated.
 * [Spatial Rules](./core/spatial-rules.md): Instruction on how to use and create new SpatialRules. SpatialRules are used to enforce country-specific routing rules.
 * [Turn Restrictions](./core/turn-restrictions.md): Details on how to enable and use turn restrictions.
 * [Isochrone generation in Java](./isochrone/java.md): Instruction on how to create isochrones using the low-level Java API.

#### Android & iOS

The Android demo, that shows how to use GraphHopper for offline routing on
Android, was available until [GraphHopper 1.0](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/tree/1.0/android).

There is a GraphHopper fork for iOS that allows to do offline routing on
iOS. See the Instructions on how to setup this [here](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-ios/) including a sample application.
See the necessary changes for modern iOS and GraphHopper 1.0 in [this pull request](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-ios/pull/47).

#### Windows

Documentation about how to get an GraphHopper instance running on windows via cygwin is available [here](./core/windows-setup.md).

#### Eclipse

Setup in IntelliJ and NetBeans is just via open project. See [this document](./core/eclipse-setup.md) 
to set up GraphHopper in Eclipse with maven.
