GraphHopper Maps uses the [Directions API for Business](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api), which provides 
routing and matrix routing through GraphHopper and also a fast address search via [Photon](https://github.com/komoot/photon).
Additionally the map tiles from various Providers like [Lyrk](https://geodienste.lyrk.de/pakete)
are used and all is available for free and through HTTPS for a secure route planning experience!
