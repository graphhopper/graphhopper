        /* FIXME 
         * 
         * Test still fails due to a potential bug in QueryGraph? 
         * Consider an edge A-->B with two points C and D along this edge. If a route from C and D has to be generated, virtual nodes and 
         * edges will be created and connected with A and B. E.g. the virtual edge C-D will be created twice: C->D with edge ID x, and D->C with edge ID y. 
         * However, the behavior of the common EdgeIterator differs from VirtualEdgeIterator. If all outgoing edges for node C are requested, the result 
         * includes the edge C->D (x) with base node C and adjacent node D. On backward direction, when requesting incoming edges, the common 
         * EdgeIterator returns C->D (x) as well, but with base node D and adjacent node C, since we traverse in opposite direction and which is totally 
         * correct behavior. However, VirtualEdgeIterator does not. It returns C->D (x) with base node C and adjacent node D for both back and forward direction, 
         * which is my eyes faulty.     
         * 
         * This problem occurs only in bidirectional edge-based algorithms, since they consider edge-ids AND the direction of edges with the help of their base and adjacent nodes.
