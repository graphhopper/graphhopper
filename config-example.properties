##### Vehicles #####
#
# Possible options: car,foot,bike,bike2,mtb,racingbike,motorcycle (comma separated)
# bike2 takes elevation data into account (like up-hill is slower than down-hill)
# and requires enabling graph.elevation.provider below
graph.flagEncoders=car

# Enable turn restrictions for car or motorcycle. 
# Currently you need to additionally set prepare.chWeightings=no before using this (see below and #270)
# graph.flagEncoders=car|turnCosts=true


##### Elevation #####
#
# To populate your graph with elevation data use SRTM, default is noop
# graph.elevation.provider=srtm
#
# default location for cache is /tmp/srtm
# graph.elevation.cachedir=./srtmprovider/
#
# If you have a slow disk or plenty of RAM change the default MMAP to:
# graph.elevation.dataaccess=RAM_STORE



##### Storage #####
#
# configure the memory access, use RAM_STORE for well equipped servers, 
# MMAP_STORE_SYNC could be used otherwise but will be a lot slower
graph.dataaccess=RAM_STORE

# if you don't need turn instruction, you can reduce storage size by not storing way names:
# osmreader.instructions=false

# will write way names in the preferred language (language code as defined in ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2):
# osmreader.preferred-language=en

#### Speed-up Mode vs. Flexibility Mode ####
#
# By default the speed-up mode with the 'fastest' weighting is used. Internally a graph preparation via
# contraction hierarchies is done to speed routing up. This requires more RAM/disc space for holding the
# graph but less for every request. You can also setup multiple weightings, by providing a coma separated list.
# prepare.chWeightings=fastest
#
# Disable the speed-up mode (contraction hierarchies, CH) via enabling the flexibility mode:
# prepare.chWeightings=no
#
# To make preparation faster for multiple flagEncoders you can increase the default threads if you have enough RAM
# prepare.threads=1

##### Web #####
# if you want to support jsonp response type you need to add it explicitely here. By default it is disabled for 
# stronger security.
# web.jsonpAllowed=true
