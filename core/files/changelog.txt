0.2.0
    refactored/renamed classes:
        TODO
    incompatible storage layout due to:
        pluggable endianness (#103) -> changed default endianess to LITTLE
    add highly experimental UnsafeDataAccess to speed up search ~15%
    several small bug fixes and improvements
    different edge insert
    important bug fix for edge retrieval which leads to massive speed up in prepare + CH algos
    finally fixed major feature request #27 to allow gps-to-gps queries instead of only junction-to-junction ones.
        follow up in #52 and #115
        slower but more precise and necessary edge distance calculation
    fixed bug #105 for disconnected areas    
    fix which made CH preparation ~5% faster
    more align API for all algorithms. and initCollection is called via 1000 not something depending on the graph size
    API changed
        case of vehicle now case does not matter
        returned distance is in meter now
    better i18n support
    fixed major bug #102 when removing subnetworks
    fixed bug #89 for trams on roads
    completed improvement #93 for ferries
    edge explorer makes none-CH algorithms ~8% faster

0.1.1
06 August 2013

    correct maven bundling and some more issues
    more i18n


0.1
23 July 2013

    initial version with lots of features 
    24 closed issues:
        https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues?milestone=3&state=closed
    e.g.:
    Route instructions
    Implement OSM import for bike/foot/car
    More compact graph (nodes along a way are stored in a separate storage => faster and reduced RAM usage)
    Made routing working world wide. Make German-sized networks working on Android.
    Made routing faster via bidirectional algorithms, contraction hierarchies, graph sorting, better OSM integration and some fine tuning.
