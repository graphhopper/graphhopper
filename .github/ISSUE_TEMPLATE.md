For questions or discussion please always use our [forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com) first and make sure you read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please be friendly and avoid the hassle to close your issue without an answer.

The best way to get help about an GraphHopper issue is to create a valid and detailed issue content, preferable with a unit or integration test reproducing the issue. Please include the version of GraphHopper, the JVM and the operating system are you using and in case of a routing problem include a link to [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/). Also tell us your expected routing result via additional markers and screenshots.

If you have an Android application using GraphHopper, please **always** post to the [forum](https://discuss.graphhopper.com/c/graphhopper/graphhopper-ios-and-android) before and include logs and the version of your Android.
