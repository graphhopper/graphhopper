/**
 * Interface for a storage abstraction. Currently is serves just the purpose to ensure the same

 * Then the lifecycle is identical for all such objects:
 * <ol>
 * <li>object creation via new</li>
 * <li>optional configuration via additional setters and getters which are not in this
 * interface</li>
 * <li>if(!storable.loadExisting()) storable.create()</li>
 * <li>usage storable and optional flush() calls in-between. Keep in mind that some data structure
 * could require a call to increase memory while usage. E.g. DataAccess.ensureCapacity()</li>
 * <li>Finally do close() which does no flush()</li>
 * </ol>
