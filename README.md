# GraphHopper Routing Engine

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper)

GraphHopper is a fast and memory-efficient routing engine released under Apache License 2.0. It can be used as a Java library or standalone web server to calculate the distance, time, turn-by-turn instructions and many road attributes for a route between two or more points. Beyond this "A-to-B" routing it supports ["snap to road"](README.md#Map-Matching), [Isochrone calculation](README.md#Analysis), [mobile navigation](README.md#mobile-apps) and [more](README.md#Features). GraphHopper uses OpenStreetMap and GTFS data by default and it can import [other data sources too](README.md#OpenStreetMap-Support).

## Installation

To install the [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/) UI and the web service locally you [need a JVM](https://adoptium.net) (>= Java 8) and do:

```bash
wget https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/releases/download/5.3/graphhopper-web-5.3.jar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/5.x/config-example.yml http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/berlin-latest.osm.pbf
java -Ddw.graphhopper.datareader.file=berlin-latest.osm.pbf -jar *.jar server config-example.yml
```

After a while you see a log message with 'Server - Started', then go to http://localhost:8989/ and
you'll see a map of Berlin. You should be able to right click on the map to create a route.

See the [documentation](./docs/index.md) that contains e.g. [the elevation guide](./docs/core/elevation.md) and the [deployment guide](./docs/core/deploy.md).

### Docker

The Docker images created by the community from the `master` branch can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/israelhikingmap/graphhopper)
(currently daily). See the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/IsraelHikingMap/graphhopper-docker-image-push) for more details.

## GraphHopper Maps

To see the road routing feature of GraphHopper in action please go to [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps).

[![GraphHopper Maps](https://karussell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/graphhopper-maps-0-4-preview.png)](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

GraphHopper Maps uses the commercial offering the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://www.graphhopper.com) under the hood, which provides the Routing API (based on this routing engine), a Route Optimization API based on [jsprit](http://jsprit.github.io/), a fast Matrix API and an address search based on [photon](https://github.com/komoot/photon). The photon project is also supported by the GraphHopper GmbH. Additionally to the GraphHopper Directions API, map tiles from various providers are used 
where the default is [Omniscale](http://omniscale.com/). All this is available for free, via encrypted connections and from German servers for a nice and private route planning experience!

## Public Transit

## Mobile Apps

### Online

There is a [web service](./navigation) that can be consumed by [our navigation Android client](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example).

[![android navigation demo app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example/master/files/graphhopper-navigation-example.png)](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation-example)

### Offline

Offline routing is [no longer officially supported](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues/1940) but should still work. See
[version 1.0](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/1.0/docs/android/index.md) with still an Android
demo and [this pull request](http://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-ios) of the iOS fork including a demo for iOS.

## Analysis

Use isochrones to calculate and visualize the reachable area for a certain travel mode

### [Isochrone Web API](./docs/web/api-doc.md#isochrone)

[![Isochrone API image](./docs/isochrone/images/isochrone.png)](./docs/web/api-doc.md#isochrone)

### [Shortest Path Tree API](//www.graphhopper.com/blog/2018/07/04/high-precision-reachability/)

[![high precision reachability image](https://www.graphhopper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/berlin-reachability-768x401.png)](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2018/07/04/high-precision-reachability/)

To support these high precision reachability approaches there is the /spt
endpoint (shortest path tree). [See #1577](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/1577)

### [Map Matching](./map-matching)

There is the map matching subproject to snap GPX traces to the road.

# Technical Overview

GraphHopper supports several routing algorithms, such as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A</a>`*` and its bidirectional variants. 
Furthermore, it allows you to use 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies">Contraction Hierarchies</a> (CH) 
very easily. We call this **speed mode**; without this CH preparation, we call it **flexible mode**.

The speed mode comes with very fast and lightweight (less RAM) responses and it does not use heuristics. 
However, only predefined vehicle profiles are possible and this additional CH preparation is time and resource consuming.

Then there is the **hybrid mode** which also requires more time and memory for the preparation,
but it is much more flexible regarding changing properties per request or e.g. integrating traffic data. 
Furthermore, this hybrid mode is slower than the speed mode, but it is an 
order of magnitude faster than the flexible mode and uses less RAM for one request.

If the preparations exist you can switch between all modes at request time.

Read more about the technical details [here](./docs/core/technical.md).

## License

We chose the Apache License to make it easy for you to embed GraphHopper in your products, even closed source.
We suggest that you contribute back your changes, as GraphHopper evolves fast,
but of course this is not necessary.

## OpenStreetMap Support

OpenStreetMap is directly supported by GraphHopper. Without the amazing data from
OpenStreetMap, GraphHopper wouldn't be possible at all. 
Other map data will need a custom import procedure, see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues/277">Ordnance Survey</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-reader-shp">Shapefile like ESRI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/OPTITOOL/morituri">Navteq</a>.

## Written in Java

GraphHopper is written in Java and officially runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

### Maven

Embed GraphHopper with OpenStreetMap support into your Java application via the following snippet:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.graphhopper</groupId>
    <artifactId>graphhopper-core</artifactId>
    <version>[LATEST-VERSION]</version>
</dependency>
```

See [our example application](./example/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/example/RoutingExample.java) to get started fast.

## Customizable

You can customize GraphHopper with Java knowledge (with a high and low level API) and also without Java knowledge using the [custom models](./docs/core/custom-models.md).

### Web UI and API

With the web module, we provide code to query GraphHopper over HTTP and decrease bandwidth usage as much as possible.
For that we use an efficient polyline encoding, the Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm, and a simple 
GZIP servlet filter.                 

On the client side, we provide a [Java](./client-hc) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-js-client)
client.

### Desktop

GraphHopper also runs on the Desktop in a Java application without internet access.
For debugging purposes GraphHopper can produce vector tiles, i.e. a visualization of the road network in the browser (see #1572). Also a more low level Swing-based UI is provided via MiniGraphUI in the tools module, see some
visualizations done with it [here](https://graphhopper.com/blog/2016/01/19/alternative-roads-to-rome/).
A fast and production ready map visualization for the Desktop can be implemented via [mapsforge](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge) or [mapsforge vtm](https://github.com/mapsforge/vtm).
