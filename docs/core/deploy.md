# Deploy Guide

This guide is written for everyone interested in deploying graphhopper on a server.

## Basics

For simplicity you could just start jetty from maven and schedule it as background job:
`./graphhopper.sh -a web -i europe_germany_berlin.pbf -d --port 11111`.
Then the service will be accessible on port 11111.

For production usage you have a web service included. Copy [this configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/master/config-example.yml)
also there and use `-c config.yml` in the script to point to it. Increase the -Xmx/-Xms values of your server server e.g.
do the following before calling graphhopper.sh:

```
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx17g -Xms17g"
```

Since JDK11 you can also play with different garbage collectors like G1, ZGC or Shenandoah. The G1 is the default but the other two GCs are better suited for JVMs with bigger heaps (>32GB) and low pauses. You enabled them with `-XX:+UseZGC` or `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`. Please note that especially ZGC and G1 require quite a bit memory additionally to the heap and so sometimes speed can be increased when you lower the `Xmx` value.

Notes:

 * If you want to support none-CH requests you should at least enable landmarks or limit the request to a certain distance otherwise it might require lots of RAM per request! See [#734](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues/734).

### API Tokens

By default, GraphHopper uses [Omniscale](http://omniscale.com/) and/or [Thunderforest](http://thunderforest.com/) as layer service.
Either you get a plan there, then set the API key in the options.js file or you
have to remove Omniscale from the [JavaScript file](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/master/web/src/main/resources/com/graphhopper/maps/js/map.js).

GraphHopper uses the [GraphHopper Directions API](https://docs.graphhopper.com/#tag/Geocoding-API) for geocoding. To be able to use the autocomplete feature of the point inputs you have to:

 * Get your API Token at: https://www.graphhopper.com/ and set this in the options.js
 * Don't forget the Attribution when using the free package

## World Wide

GraphHopper is able to handle coverage for the whole [OpenStreetMap road network](http://planet.osm.org/).
It needs approximately 25GB RAM for the import (CAR only) and ~1 hour (plus ~5h for contraction).
If you can accept slower import times this can be reduced to 14GB RAM - you'll need to set `datareader.dataaccess=MMAP` in the config file.

Then 'only' 15GB are necessary and without contraction hierarchy this can be further reduced to about 9GB.

### System tuning

Avoid swapping e.g. on linux via `vm.swappiness=0` in /etc/sysctl.conf. See some tuning discussion in the answers [here](http://stackoverflow.com/q/38905739/194609).

### Elevation Data

If you want to use elevation data you need to increase the allowed number of open files. Under linux this works as follows:

 * sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf
 * add: `* - nofile 100000`
   which means set hard and soft limit of "number of open files" for all users to 100K
 * sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
 * add: `fs.file-max = 90000`
 * reboot now (or sudo sysctl -p; and re-login)
 * afterwards `ulimit -Hn` and `ulimit -Sn` should give you 100000
