# Specify a vehicle (FlagEncoder) or another custom profile like
base: car

# Trucks are slower so limit all speed to this value. In km/h
vehicle_max_speed: 100
# in meter
vehicle_height: 3.8
vehicle_width: 2.5
# in tons
vehicle_weight: 4.5

# Let's change the estimated average speed for motorway to 100 km/h
# Please note that in contrast to the other factors (like priority or speed_factor) the first match determines the value
# I.e. if a road_class==motorway and road_environment==bridge, then the resulting average_speed=100
average_speed:
  road_class:
    motorway: 95
    residential: 30
  road_environment:
    bridge: 85

# The formula is defined in CustomWeighting, where the speed_factor can be used to increase speed and decrease speed
# It is important to note that if two conditions are satisfied the values are multiplied e.g. if road_class==motorway
# and road_environment==tunnel, then the resulting speed is average_speed*0.85*0.9. The minimum value is 0.
speed_factor:
  road_environment:
    tunnel: 0.85
  # trucks should be a bit slower on certain road classes compared to the 'base' car
  # a more compact JSON-way to list the properties, fully YAML-compatible:
  road_class: { motorway: 0.85, primary: 0.9 }

# Now we want to set a preference without changing the speed. I.e. trucks shall prefer bigger roads and so we could
# increase the speed for them, but this is ugly, so we use priority that does not influence the speed.
# The default priority 1 won't change something. Higher than 1 will prefer the road under the specified condition
# and lower than 1 will avoid it. If two conditions are met the values will be multiplied. The minimum value is 0.
priority:
  road_class:
    motorway: 1.1
    residential: 0.5
    # cars allow tracks so we should block them here, but in the example in CustomWeightingRouteResourceTest the bridge is only accessible through a track
    # track: 0
  # avoid toll roads (prefer roads with 'no' toll)
  toll: { no: 1.5 }
  # let's assume we transport gas: so NEVER go on restricted roads with hazmat==no
  hazmat: { no: 0 }
  # allow delivery access
  road_access: { delivery: 1 }
  # avoid turns if possible and links are one simple indication for that
  # TODO booleans are not yet supported here
